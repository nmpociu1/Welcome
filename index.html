  <body> 
      <p1> This is my personal portfolio here on github, where some of mycoding that i've done throughout this year in Computer Science and math. Here on this page I have tried to include a variety of different projects throughout this year that I am proud of, also to show the different levels that i've gone through in my knowledge in coding. I hope to continue this page as I try to continue to update it in the future. Please continue to the links to my projects and some info on each of them. I hope to do some form of Computer Science in college along with graphic design. (example below)

    <p1> The projects you will see below come from a couple of different programs such as Jeroo and p5.js </p1>
    <h2 style = "background-color:purple;color:blue"> Links to my Projects through this year </h2>
    <p> Here is a link to my paint project : <a href="https://nmpociu1.github.io/Paint-Project/"target = new window> Paint Project</a></p>
    <p1> (Still don't have this worked out the right way) This here is a drawing program made in p5.js. We made this as our end of the sememester project and it might have been the most fun I have had with coding. I enjoy art and especially when its wrapped up with working with computers so it was a perfect combination. In this program through the if mouse is over and if mouse is clicked functions I was able to make it so that when I click a colored square my "brush" would turn to that color.

    <p> Here is a Link to my acceleration and gravity project :<a href="https://nmpociu1.github.io/gravity/"target= new window> Gravity/Acceleration Project</a></p>
    <p1> (Still don't have this worked out the right way) This drawing was made in p5.js. Our class made this project not too long ago as a more complex topic. I choose to put this in as it was complex and and combined both the idea of gravity as well as acceleration. The gravity being the balls falling and boucning and the acceleration being when you click a "wind" will come through and move the balls in that direction</p1>
    <p> Here is a Link to my color out project :<a href="https://nmpociu1.github.io/color_out/"target= new window> Color Out Project</a></p>
    <p1> (Still don't have this worked out the right way) This drawing was made in p5.js. Our class made this shorty after the start of the second semester. In this project the snowman image present will have a different color overlay depending on what command you put in.
